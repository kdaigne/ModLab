# MELODY preprocessor #

Opens the MELODY preprocessor configuration file and a supplementary file to launch it and automatically copy the files created into the simulation folder. 

/!\ Execution must be performed from the main file and not from MELODY preprocessor directly. If not, the files created will be stored in the interface directory, and not in the simulation directory.
