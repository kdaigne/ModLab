# GUI main view

# Prerequisites
The following components are required:
- MATLAB R2024a (with App Designer)
- Toolbox: Image Processing Toolbox
- Toolbox: Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
An older version of MATLAB may work, but some features will be inaccessible, leading to errors. To start the GUI, double-click on ModLab.lnk (the shortcut in the main folder). If it does not work (e.g. for macOS), double-click on \Functions\Management\main.mlapp.
